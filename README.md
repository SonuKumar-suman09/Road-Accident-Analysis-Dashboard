Road accidents are one of the major causes of injuries, disabilities, and fatalities across the world. With the rapid growth of population, urbanization, and vehicle ownership, the number of road accidents has increased significantly. These accidents not only lead to loss of human life but also create serious economic and social impacts. Therefore, analysing road accident data is essential to understand accident patterns and to design effective safety measures.

This project focuses on Road Accident Analysis using Microsoft Power BI, a powerful Business Intelligence tool that helps convert large volumes of raw data into meaningful visual insights. By using interactive dashboards, decision-makers can quickly identify accident trends, severity levels, high-risk locations, and contributing factors.

Road accident datasets are usually large, complex, and collected from multiple sources. Traditional analysis methods, such as manual reporting or spreadsheet-based analysis, are often time-consuming and prone to errors. Moreover, static reports make it difficult to identify trends and patterns over time.
Business Intelligence tools like Power BI provide advanced features such as data transformation, data modeling, and dynamic visualization. Power BI enables users to analyse historical data efficiently and present insights in the form of dashboards, charts, maps, and KPIs. This project demonstrates the practical application of Power BI in the domain of road safety analysis and highlights its importance in data-driven decision-making.
The primary objective of this analysis is to explore and understand patterns in Road Accident Analysis. By examining demographic variables such as Casualties of Accident this project aims to:
1. Compare current year (CY) and previous year (PY) accident and casualty trends.
Year-wise comparison helps in identifying whether road safety has improved or declined. It also shows seasonal patterns and trends over time.
2. Examine casualties based on vehicle type.
This objective helps in identifying which vehicle types (car, bike, bus, van, etc.) are most involved in accidents. It supports targeted safety rules for high-risk vehicles.
3. Analyze accident distribution across urban and rural areas.
This analysis helps in understanding where accidents occur more frequently. It supports better traffic planning and infrastructure development in high-risk areas.
4. Identify high-risk road types contributing to maximum casualties.
Different road types have different accident risks. This objective helps in identifying unsafe road structures such as single carriageways.
5. Study the impact of light conditions, weather conditions, and road surface on accidents.
Environmental factors strongly influence accident occurrence. This analysis helps in understanding how visibility and weather affect road safety.
6. Identify accident-prone locations using geographical map visualization.
Map analysis helps in locating accident hotspots. These insights can be used to improve traffic signals, road design, and safety measures.

Data Preprocessing
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor in Power BI. Data preprocessing is an important step to ensure accuracy and reliability of the analysis. The following steps were performed:
•	Removal of missing and null values
•	Elimination of duplicate records
•	Correction of incorrect or inconsistent data types
•	Standardization of categorical variables such as vehicle type and road type
•	Creation of calculated columns such as year, month, and day
•	Creation of a separate date table for time-intelligence analysis
•	Establishment of relationships between fact and dimension tables
These preprocessing steps improved data quality and ensured accurate aggregation and filtering across visuals.
Analysis on Dataset
The processed data was analysed using multiple Power BI visuals and DAX measures.
Accident and Casualty Analysis
KPI cards were used to display total current-year accidents and casualties. Casualties were categorized into fatal, serious, and slight injuries. The analysis shows a reduction in casualties compared to the previous year, indicating improvement in road safety.
Vehicle Type Analysis
Bar charts were used to analyse casualties by vehicle type. Cars were responsible for the highest number of casualties, followed by bikes and vans. Agricultural and other vehicles contributed comparatively fewer casualties.
Trend Analysis
Line charts were used to compare monthly trends of current-year and previous-year casualties. Seasonal variations were observed, with certain months showing higher accident rates. Overall, the current-year trend shows a decline compared to the previous year.
Area and Road Type Analysis
Pie and bar charts revealed that urban areas account for a higher percentage of casualties than rural areas. Single carriageway roads recorded the highest number of accidents, indicating higher risk on such roads.
Environmental Condition Analysis
Analysis based on light conditions showed that most accidents occur during daytime, mainly due to high traffic volume. Weather and road surface conditions also impacted accident frequency.
Location-Based Analysis
Map visualization highlighted accident hotspots across regions. Dense clusters indicate areas that require immediate safety measures and infrastructure improvements.
Conclusion
The Road Accident Analysis dashboard successfully converts complex accident data into meaningful and actionable insights. The analysis highlights that vehicle type, road type, urban traffic density, and environmental conditions play a major role in accident occurrence. Power BI proved to be an effective tool for data visualization and analysis, enabling stakeholders to quickly understand trends and make informed decisions. This project demonstrates the importance of data analytics in improving road safety and reducing casualties.

  
Future Scope
The project can be further enhanced in the following ways:
•	Integration of real-time accident data from traffic systems
•	Application of machine learning models to predict accident-prone zones
•	Inclusion of demographic data such as age and gender of victims
•	Development of drill-through reports for detailed analysis
•	Implementation of automated alerts for high-risk areas
These improvements can help authorities take proactive steps toward accident prevention.
